Olivaw
===================================

A PhantomJS-based tool (ROBOT) for automated downloading of Amazon Associates [earning|orders|etc] reports.

How It Works
------------

PhantomJS is a headless browser which one drives using Javascript.  This makes it very easy to login to the Associates site, which is otherwise difficult to do programmatically.

PhantomJS, as of this writing, doesn't support file downloads, so Olivaw uses an XMLHttpRequest to get the contents of the report.  Since we can't easily share data between the Amazon page (where the XMLHttpRequest is created) and the backend Olivaw script, we monitor calls to console.log() via PhantomJS's onConsoleMessage callback, and pass the report data to Olivaw through a console.log(); Olivaw can then save the report to disk.  Hacky, but it works.

Requirements
------------

PhantomJS 1.9.8 (BUILD FROM SOURCE: https://github.com/ariya/phantomjs/tree/1.9 ; contains bugfixes we need)
Amazon Associates account in locale(s) of choice

Use
---

Run it from the command line like this:

phantomjs --ignore-ssl-errors=yes --local-to-remote-url-access=yes olivaw.js <username> <password> <locale> <report type> <date> <format>

The PhantomJS arguments help us avoid getting any show-stopping errors while using Olivaw.

Script Arguments
----------------

All of these are required and listed in the order in which they should appear in the command line.  The given value choices are case-sensitive.

* Associates Username
* Associates Password
* Locale: CA, CN, DE, ES, MX, FR, IT, JP, UK, US
* Report Type: orders, earnings, misc, linkType, trends, tags
* Date: yesterday, lastSevenDays, monthToDate, lastMonth, QuarterToDate, q1, q2, q3, q4, YYYYMMDD-YYYYMMDD
  * Be careful choosing too large a date range for your report; Amazon's site tends to timeout on the first request of large reports.
* Format: xml, csv

Examples
--------

CSV orders report for "yesterday" in US locale:
* phantomjs --ignore-ssl-errors=yes --local-to-remote-url-access=yes olivaw.js US user pass orders yesterday csv

XML earnings report for the month-to-date in UK locale:
* phantomjs --ignore-ssl-errors=yes --local-to-remote-url-access=yes olivaw.js UK user pass earnings monthToDate xml
